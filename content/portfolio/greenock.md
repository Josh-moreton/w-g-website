In the bustling town of Greenock, we recently completed a transformative bathroom renovation project that involved more than just a mere facelift.

By boldly reimagining the space, we bid farewell to an awkward little hallway, opting instead to extend the bathroom by an additional meter. This decision wasn't just about expanding square footage; it was about unlocking the full potential of the space, enhancing both its functionality and aesthetic appeal.

With careful planning and precise execution, we seamlessly integrated the new extension, seamlessly blending it with the existing layout to create a cohesive and harmonious environment. The result? A bathroom that not only boasts increased spaciousness but also exudes a sense of modernity and sophistication, truly elevating the living experience for our client in Greenock.
